                        <p><strong>Methods of Cultivation:</strong> Climate Requirements:

                            Grows best in semi-arid and subtropical regions.
                            Requires moderate rainfall (600-750 mm), but too much water can harm the plant.
                            Can tolerate temperatures between 20°C to 35°C.

                            Soil Requirements:

                            Prefers well-drained sandy or loamy soil with good aeration.
                            pH range: 7.5 to 8 (neutral to slightly alkaline).

                            Propagation:

                            Grown from seeds: Seeds are sown directly in the soil or started in nursery beds.
                            Optimal seed rate: 5-7 kg per hectare.

                            Planting Season:

                            Best sown during the early monsoon season (June-July).
                            Transplanting can be done once seedlings are 30-35 days old.

                            Irrigation:

                            Requires minimal water; irrigation is needed only during dry spells.
                            Overwatering can lead to root rot.

                            Pest and Disease Control:

                            Susceptible to leaf spot disease and root rot in poorly drained soils.
                            Insects like aphids can be controlled with organic insecticides.

                            Harvesting:

                            Ready for harvest 150-180 days after planting.
                            Roots are the primary medicinal part. They are dug out, cleaned, dried, and processed.
                            Yields around 400-500 kg of roots per hectare.</p>
